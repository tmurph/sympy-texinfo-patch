Introduction
============

In this tutorial we present examples from Wester's article concerning
comparison and critique of mathematical abilities of several computer
algebra systems (see [Wester1999]_). All the examples are related to
polynomial and algebraic computations and SymPy specific remarks were
added to all of them.
