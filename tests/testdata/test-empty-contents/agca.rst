.. epigraph::
   Algebraic geometry is a mixture of the ideas of two Mediterranean
   cultures. It is the superposition of the Arab science of the lightening
   calculation of the solutions of equations over the Greek art of position
   and shape.
   This tapestry was originally woven on European soil and is still being refined
   under the influence of international fashion. Algebraic geometry studies the
   delicate balance between the geometrically plausible and the algebraically
   possible.  Whenever one side of this mathematical teeter-totter outweighs the
   other, one immediately loses interest and runs off in search of a more exciting
   amusement.

   -- George R. Kempf (1944 -- 2002)


Algebraic Geometry refers to the study of geometric problems via algebraic
methods (and sometimes vice versa). While this is a rather old topic,
algebraic geometry as understood today is very much a 20th century
development. Building on ideas of e.g. Riemann and Dedekind, it was realized
that there is an intimate connection between properties of the set of
solutions of a system of polynomial equations (called an algebraic variety)
and the behavior of the set of polynomial functions on that variety
(called the coordinate ring).
